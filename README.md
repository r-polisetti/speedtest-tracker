    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/speedtest-tracker:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    container_name: speedtest-tracker
    ports:
      - 8080:80          # Web UI
      - 8443:443         # HTTPS
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - APP_NAME=Speedtest-tracker
      - APP_TIMEZONE=Asia/Kolkata
      - DISPLAY_TIMEZONE=Asia/Kolkata
      - TZ=Asia/Kolkata
      - SPEEDTEST_SCHEDULE=*/30 * * * *
      - APP_KEY=base64:your-generated-app-key
      - DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
````

> 📌 **Note**: Replace `your-generated-app-key` with your own key from [Speedtest Tracker App Key Generator](https://speedtest-tracker.dev/)

## 🕒 Scheduling

This setup runs a speed test every **30 minutes**, using the cron expression:

```
*/30 * * * *
```

You can modify this via the `SPEEDTEST_SCHEDULE` environment variable.

## 🙋‍♂️ Why I Built This

> *"Is it just me, or is the internet slow again?"*  
> *— Everyone, all the time*

It all started when people kept complaining about internet speed.  
But every time I ran a speed test — boom 💥 — speeds looked perfect. Suspiciously perfect.

So I asked myself:

![giphy](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92cf6a43-33bc-4f95-942e-e67f2e845c26)


**Is my ISP really delivering what they promise all the time?**  
I started manually testing using:
- Speedtest.net  
- Fast.com  
- MyFibre app  

But then I thought, *how many times can I keep running these tests like a caveman?*

---

### 💡 The Idea

Let’s automate it!  
I set up `speedtest-cli` with `cron` jobs to run tests on a schedule. Great. ✅  
But then came the **next challenge**:  
📊 **Data analysis.**

My terminal started looking like Matrix logs — tons of numbers, no insight.  
This was spiraling out of hand.

---

### 🔍 Enter: **Speedtest Tracker**

I figured, *someone must’ve solved this already*.  
A quick search led me to the amazing open-source project: **Speedtest Tracker**.

And wow — what a tool:

✅ Beautiful UI  
📈 Real-time graphs & charts  
📥 Exportable Excel reports (perfect to send to the ISP)  
🚀 Quick Docker setup  
🔔 Smart notifications when speeds drop

I configured it to alert me if speeds fall below:
- **Download:** 120 Mbps  
- **Upload:** 120 Mbps  

Now, when things go sideways — I *know exactly when and how*.

---

### 🚀 TL;DR

Tired of arguing with your ISP about inconsistent speeds?  
Set up Speedtest Tracker with Docker, and let the graphs do the talking.  
I’ve even attached screenshots to show you how it looks.

Try it yourself — it’s a great tool!
